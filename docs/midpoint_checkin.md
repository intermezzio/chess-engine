# How are you feeling about the current state of the project?

The current state of the project is pretty good!
We have progress on a chess evaluation function and
are pretty close to an MVP for the project.

# What have you accomplished up until this point?

We've been able to create a few things:

* A basic chess engine that plays random moves
* An evaluation function that returns a number
based on the current position
* A simulator where our engine plays a real chess engine

# What are your immediate next steps?

* Get evaluation to accept castling and en passant (edge cases)
* Use a BFS or other tree traversal with the evaluation function

# Have you rescaled the project since submitting the proposal? If so, what changes have been made?

We haven't rescaled the project. It's going well.

# (If applicable) How is the teaming situation going?

Teaming is memeing. Acutally though, we're doing very
well as a team. We're both interested in the project
and collaborate well.

# Is there any way the DSA teaching team can support you?

Physically impossible

# Is there anything else you would like the teaching team to know?

No!!!
